\opening{Dear User,}


Uuugh, I don't know how to tell you this so I am just going to come out and
say it.  It's over.  There, bam, I'm sorry.  I would have liked to do this 
face-to-face or over the phone (but I am a computer).  So it goes.

I just need some time to work on myself.  You obviously were not paying enough 
attention to me.  You were always writing some paper or proceeding.  ``Publish or 
perish,'' I know.  Well you'd think that \emph{occassionally} you would be able 
to spend some time writing me.  I am publication too!  You write me, you copyright
me, and you put me out there in the world for others to read.  You would think that 
counts for something.  I have heard your arguments over and over and over that I 
can't get you a shiny faculty gig.  I think that is ridiculous.  Thousands of 
lines of code, a Ph.D., and a post-doc later and \emph{now} the review committee 
won't give me the time since epoch?!

Also there is this unatural obsession you have with the novelness of your work.
I understand that you want to do something new, something that distinguishes you.
You are smart. You have had some wins.  But look, science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics are cummulative pursuits.  These things get built up over time.
Also, you are human.  You live and work in a community of people very similar to you.  
Most of them share this ridiculous prediliction with you.  I'll let you do the math
about a group of people with effectively the same training all trying to do something
differentially new at the same time.

You wanna do something really novel?  Run the same simulation twice and get the same
answer!  Bonus points for recording and saving for posterity exactly what you did to
get that answer.

OK, I am not saying that it isn't a noble pursuit to try to do something unique.  
But it isn't the only worthwhile pursuit.  I have needs too!  I feel like the quality
of my code base has decreased in the years that I have stood by you.  This \emph{will}
come back to bite you.  $P=1$. I do not want to be around when that happens.

Listen, I know that I am not perfect.  I am sorry.  Total reproducibility is hard.
It requires a lot of active, concetrated effort on your part.  With out anyone 
forcing it down your throught, easy to understand that you dropped this whole 
long-term reproducibility thing with all that you are juggling.  In my humble 
opinion, it is a failure of the education system that reproducibility wasn't 
beaten into you to the point of self-regulation.  \emph{C'est la vie}, nothing we can 
do about that now.

But it is not as if there are no tools out there whatsoever.  I know how much you
love labeling directories `v01', `v02', `v03', etc.  But honey, there are version 
control systems out there.  There are things called test suites I think that you 
would really like if you gave them a shot.  (Plus you can sell them to your PI as 
part of your V\&V/UQ effort.)  Oh and since you like writing so much, you should 
really look into documentation tools.  Using them is like writing a paper, only
\emph{even more technical} (and prettier).

I know you have your workflow.  But it is so manual that my friends mistake you for
a ditch digger.  And we never go out anymore because YOU spend all of your time 
flirting with that tease BASH.  (``Most religious terminal,'' yeah, right.)

Sorry, sorry, I got worked up there.  Maybe I should just be invisible.  You are 
right that even if you adopted all of the tools I just mentioned you are only
half way to real simulation reproducipbility.  Easy-to-use, transparent environment
and workflow capturing tools just are not widely available out there.  And even if
they were, it probabaly wouldn't be a walk in the park making such tools work with
that FORTRAN 2 code everyone seems to think is so magical.   

I knew you were like this when we started running together.  And to be fair, you 
haven't changed all that much.  So it is not really you, it's me. But for my own sake 
I am going to have to find someone who respects me for who I am, maybe 
a software developer.  I hope that we can still be friends...


Love Always,\\
